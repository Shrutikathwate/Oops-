        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "    - Gemini\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.Class contains attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. If a class is a blueprint, then an object is the real thing built from that blueprint.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it. Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "   - Encapsulation wrapping data and methods into a single unit, and controlling access to them. It focuses on data hiding. Achieved using access modifiers.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - dunder methods are special, predefined methods that start and end with double underscores. They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods let you define how objects of a class behave with built-in functions, operators, and standard behaviors.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "   - Inheritance is one of the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. It allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. This promotes code reusability, extensibility, and helps avoid duplication.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - polymorphism means the same function, method, or operator can behave differently depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "   It allows us to write flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit , and controlling access to them. It helps in data hiding and ensures that objects can only be modified in controlled ways.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It is mainly used to initialize (set up) the attributes of an object.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Class methods (@classmethod) take cls as the first argument and can access/modify class-level data.\n",
        "   - Static methods (@staticmethod) don't take self or cls, and act as utility functions that don't depend on class or instance data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding happens when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class. The method in the child must have the same name, parameters, and return type.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator is used in Python to turn a method into an attribute-like property. It allows you to access methods like attributes, providing controlled access to private variables without directly exposing them.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    - Code Reusability → Same function/method can work with different object types.\n",
        "    - Flexibility → Objects of different classes can be treated through a common interface.\n",
        "    - Extensibility → New classes can be added without changing existing code.\n",
        "    - Readability & Maintainability → Cleaner, more intuitive code that models real-world behavior.\n",
        "    - Supports Dynamic Behavior → Enables runtime method overriding, making programs more adaptable.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Modularity → Code is organized into classes/objects, making it structured and easy to manage.\n",
        "    - Reusability → Classes and methods can be reused across programs (through inheritance).\n",
        "    - Encapsulation → Protects data by restricting direct access and allowing controlled modification.\n",
        "    - Polymorphism → Same method or operator can work differently for different objects.\n",
        "    - Abstraction → Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "    - Scalability & Maintainability → Easy to update, extend, or debug without affecting the entire program.\n",
        "    - Real-world Modeling → Objects represent real-world entities, making code more intuitive.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "    - Shared across all objects of a class. Defined inside the class but outside methods. Accessed using class name or object.\n",
        "    - Unique to each object. Defined inside methods with self. Accessed only through the object.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The child class gets access to the attributes and methods of all parent classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Called by str(obj) or print(obj). Goal: Return a readable, user-friendly string.\n",
        "    - Called by repr(obj) or in the Python shell when you just type the object name.Goal: Return an unambiguous string, ideally one that can recreate the object.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - The super() function is used to call methods of a parent (base) class inside a child (derived) class. Mainly used in inheritance to avoid directly naming the parent class. Ensures that the Method Resolution Order (MRO) is followed.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - __del__ is a destructor method in Python.It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when there are no more references to it). Purpose: To release resources (like closing files, database connections, or freeing memory) before the object is deleted.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - @staticmethod Doesn’t take self or cls as the first argument. Works like a normal function but placed inside a class for organization. Used for helper/utility functions that don’t depend on instance or class data.\n",
        "    - @classmethod Takes cls as the first argument (refers to the class itself). Can access and modify class-level variables.Used when you want methods that affect the class as a whole, not just one object.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism means same method name, different behavior depending on the object. In inheritance, a child class can override a parent class method. When you call the method, Python decides at runtime which version to use (parent’s or child’s).\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line.Each method returns the object itself (self), so the next method can be called immediately. Makes code shorter and more readable.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __call__ method makes an object callable like a function. If a class defines __call__, then its objects can be used with () parentheses.\n",
        "    - This is useful for cases where you want an object to have function-like behavior but also maintain internal state."
